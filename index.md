I am a Computer Science student at CSUF and I expect to graduate in 2027.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 7, part 1 was one of my favorites because I found it to be useful information when asking for two dates, in this case it was a start date and an end date. With this lab I learn how to calculate the number of days between two dates. Thus reminding this laboratory of Google Sheets when we enter the information into the cells.

Lab 8, part 1 was one of my favorites because I found it very interesting to know how Mad Libs comes to involve a sentence with blank spaces. Therefore, I was able to learn to write a program that filled in the blank spaces in a sentence, in this case being the ingredients of a sandwich. Thus, being a laboratory that, apart from having to do work, was fun and, above all, knowing that programs like these can be very useful, such as at cash registers or for placing orders.

Lab 10, part 2 was one of my favorites because I found it interesting to see how we can use coding to obtain results from many data such as the 58 counties of California and the population. With this laboratory I was able to learn and see how, instead of creating two different vectors, the same information could be organized into a two-dimensional one. This being something incredible like being able to do two things at the same time since the counties and at the same time the population were being created.
